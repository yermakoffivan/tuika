//! Terminal image rendering via the Kitty, iTerm2, and Sixel graphics protocols.
//!
//! A cell in ratatui's buffer carries one grapheme plus a style and nothing
//! else, so a picture has no home there — the same wall [`crate::term::hyperlink`]
//! (OSC 8), [`crate::term::clipboard`] (OSC 52), and [`crate::term::progress`] (OSC 9;4) hit.
//! Like them, images are emitted out-of-band as an escape sequence, past the
//! cell buffer. Unlike them, the graphics escape is **not** cursor-neutral — it
//! paints at the cursor — so emission is split from layout:
//!
//! 1. An [`Image`](crate::components::Image) view reserves a `cols × rows` cell
//!    footprint via `View::measure`, so the flex solver lays out around it like
//!    any leaf.
//! 2. On `View::render` it records its absolute painted [`Rect`] plus a
//!    handle to its pixels into a shared [`ImageLayer`] (cheap to clone, cleared
//!    each frame — the ownership shape of [`RectProbe`](crate::probe::RectProbe)),
//!    and paints the reserved cells blank (or the alt-text placeholder when the
//!    terminal can't show the image) so ratatui's diff has stable content there.
//! 3. **After** the frame is painted, [`Runner`](crate::Runner) emits the layer,
//!    moving the cursor to each image's cell origin and writing its protocol's
//!    escape inside a cursor save/restore. Custom hosts perform the same step
//!    with [`ImageLayer::emit`].
//!
//! Decoding (PNG/JPEG → RGBA) is intentionally the host's job — it is a heavy
//! dependency, kept out of tuika exactly like syntax highlighting is (see
//! [`mod@crate::highlight`]). tuika owns presentation only: protocol encoding, cell
//! reservation, and the fallback. The host hands in raw RGBA via [`ImageData`].
//!
//! Graphics protocols do not degrade as harmlessly as an unknown OSC — an
//! unsupported terminal may paint the payload as garbage — so this is the first
//! tuika feature to gate on real capability detection ([`ImageSupport::detect`]).
//! See `knowledge/specs/images.md` for the full design and phased plan.
//!
//! The view half lives in [`components::image`](crate::components::Image); what
//! is here is everything that speaks to the terminal rather than to the cell
//! grid, which is why it sits beside the other out-of-band escapes.
