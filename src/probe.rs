//! Reading laid-out rects back out of the view tree.
//!
//! tuika's solver assigns every view a screen [`Rect`], but keeps it internal —
//! views render into the rect they're handed and return nothing. A host that
//! builds an app UI still needs some of those rects *after* the layout runs: to
//! place the terminal cursor inside a composer, to bound a mouse selection to
//! the transcript, or to register a clickable region. [`RectProbe`] closes that
//! gap: wrap a view in [`Probe`] and the rect it was painted into is recorded
//! into a shared handle the host can read once the frame is painted.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let input = RectProbe::new();
//! let root = view! {
//!     col {
//!         grow(1) { node(transcript) }
//!         fixed(3) { node(input.wrap(composer)) }   // reserve + probe the input
//!     }
//! };
//! paint(frame.buffer_mut(), area, &theme, root.as_ref(), &[]);
//! // Now `input.rect()` is where the composer landed — place the cursor in it.
//! ```
