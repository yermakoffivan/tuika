//! Focus-scoping container — override the render context's focus flag for a
//! subtree.
//!
//! Focus is carried on the [`RenderCtx`], and [`paint`](crate::paint) renders
//! the whole tree from one root context, so a plain [`Flex`](crate::components::Flex) can't
//! hand a single child `focused = true`. Multi-pane apps need exactly that: the
//! active pane's border should light up while the others stay dim. [`FocusScope`]
//! wraps a subtree and renders it with an explicit focus flag, so each pane can
//! be marked focused or not independently of the frame's root context — and any
//! focus-aware view inside it (notably [`Boxed`](crate::components::Boxed)) recolors
//! accordingly.

/// A layout-transparent wrapper that renders its child with an explicit focus
/// flag.
///
/// Measures and draws exactly as the wrapped view does — it only overrides
/// [`RenderCtx::focused`] for the subtree, so a focus-aware child (e.g.
/// [`Boxed`](crate::components::Boxed)) picks the focused or unfocused theme color even
/// though the surrounding frame shares one root context.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use tuika::prelude::*;
/// use tuika::testing::render;
///
/// // Two panes in one frame: the left one focused, the right one not — each
/// // Boxed border resolves its own color despite the shared root context.
/// let panes = Flex::row()
///     .grow(1, element(FocusScope::focused(element(Boxed::new(element(Text::raw("active")))))))
///     .grow(1, element(FocusScope::unfocused(element(Boxed::new(element(Text::raw("idle")))))));
///
/// let buffer = render(&panes, 24, 3, &Theme::default());
/// # let _ = buffer;
